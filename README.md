## How to contribute:

In short you need to: 

- Fork the project.
- Clone the forked repo locally.
- Add some great stuff locally, push to your forked repo.
- Then fire up a pull request to this repo.


For more details, here are the steps to follow along.

- **First, fork the project on github.**

- **Use git to clone & setup your forked project locally.**

<br>

```sh

    # after cloning, navigate to the project

    # to sync with origin
    git remote add upstream <main_repo_url>
    git remote add origin <your_forked_repo_url>
    
    # to setup your locat dev branch
    git branch your_local_branch
    git checkout your_local_branch

    # to add your changes
    git add *
    git commit -m "+your_local_branch: your commit here"

    # push to your forked repo
    git push origin your_local_branch


```

<br>


- **Now, that your work is on github, you can go ahead & fire up a pull request.**

After doing so, I will be prompted to review your code to see if it will be merged or not. Thanks for your hard work & take care! 

<br>


Also by doing so, if any updates are made to the main repo `master` branch, you can easily get the latest updates with  `git pull upstream master`
